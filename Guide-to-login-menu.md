# Login menu
Data files (your encrypted collections of notes) are managed from the login menu when starting Marbles.
A default data file "data.mbls" is created when first starting Marbles. You can rename it (Press ```X```) if you prefer a different file name. The following options are available from the login menu:

Login to the selected data file by typing your password in the input field.
Use the ```Left/Right``` arrow keys select a data file within the current directory.
Use the ```Up/Down``` arrow keys to select the desired directory
Press ```Space``` to move the selected data file to another directory
Press ```Esc``` to clear the login field/close the options menu
Press ```CTRL+W``` and one of the following keys to enable additional options:

- ```I``` to show data file info
- ```N``` to create a new data file
- ```X``` to rename the selected data file
- ```C``` to create a copy (duplicate) of the selected data file
- ```D``` to delete the selected data file
- ```M``` to merge or export data files
- ```R``` to refresh (redraw) the interface
- ```Y``` to restart Marbles
- ```L``` to show the log
- ```S``` to edit the application settings file (can also be done directly from the file system)
- ```Q``` to exit Marbles

Marbles automatically creates the "data" directory in the same directory as the executable.
New directories within the data directory must be created manually. Refresh the interface (Press ```R``` or press one of the arrow keys) to detect new directories (subdirectories are not supported in the Marbles data file structure).
