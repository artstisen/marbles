# Entry lists
Marbles can display your entries in different lists (or views) as described here. 

### Search (Key: S)
Search all entries in the current datafile.
Search results can be sorted by date changed, date created and alphabetically by title (Key: Tab).

### Favorites (Key: F)
Collect your favorite entries in the favorites list (sorted by Date changed).
Pin entries to the top of the favorites list (Key: P) and arrange them in the order you like (Key: Tab)
Colorize pinned entries to highlight them (Keys: CTRL+W, 1-3)

### Top 20 (Key: T)
Shows the 20 recent edited entries sorted by date changed.

### Session history (Key: M)
Shows the entries viewed in the current session, sorted by first to last.
A session starts when logging into a data file and ends when logging out.
This list is practical when switching back and fourth between several entries in a session.
