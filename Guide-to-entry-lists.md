# Entry lists
Marbles can display your entries in different lists (or views) as described here. 

### Search ```S```
Search all entries in the current datafile.
Search results can be sorted by date changed, date created and alphabetically by title (Press ```Tab```).

### Favorites ```F```
Collect your favorite entries in the favorites list (sorted by Date changed).
Pin entries to the top of the favorites list (Key: P) and arrange them in the order you like (Press ```Tab```)
Colorize pinned entries to highlight them (Press ```CTRL+W, 1-3```)

### Top 20 ```T```
Shows the 20 recent edited entries sorted by date changed.

### Session history ```M```
Shows the entries viewed in the current session, sorted by first to last.
A session starts when logging into a data file and ends when logging out.
This list is practical when switching back and fourth between several entries in a session.

### List all ```L```
